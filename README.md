### Synopsis
In *The Boys*, superheroes, known as **Supes**, are highly popular but also deeply flawed, often abusing their powers for personal gain, fame, and fortune. The series follows a group of ordinary people, known as **The Boys**, who are determined to expose the truth about these corrupt heroes and take them down.

The leader of The Boys is **Billy Butcher** (played by **Karl Urban**), a vengeful and ruthless man who has a personal vendetta against the most powerful superhero, **Homelander** (played by **Antony Starr**). Homelander is a patriotic, God-like hero who hides a dark and twisted nature beneath his golden-boy image.

# My Favorite Movie
My favorite movie is *Inception*. It is a science fiction thriller that explores the concept of dreams within dreams.

## Synopsis
Dom Cobb (played by **Leonardo DiCaprio**) is a thief who specializes in the art of "extraction" â€“ stealing valuable secrets from deep within a person's subconscious while they dream. After a failed job, Cobb is given a chance at redemption by an influential businessman, **Saito** (played by **Ken Watanabe**). Saito offers Cobb a seemingly impossible task: to perform **inception**, planting an idea in the mind of a corporate heir, **Robert Fischer** (played by **Cillian Murphy**).

To accomplish this, Cobb assembles a team of specialists, including **Arthur** (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), **Ariadne** (Elliot Page), **Eames** (Tom Hardy), and **Yusuf** (Dileep Rao). Together, they must navigate through multiple layers of dreams, facing challenges, dangers, and their own subconscious projections, all while racing against time.

But Cobb is also haunted by memories of his wife, **Mal** (Marion Cotillard), whose presence in his dreams complicates his mission. As the team dives deeper into the dream world, Cobb must confront his own guilt and the fine line between reality and illusion.
